- ü§ñ AI-powered analysis using xAI's Grok Vision
- üìä Probability assessment and stage classification
- ü©∫ Medical-grade diagnostic reasoning
- üì± Responsive web interface
- üé≠ Demo mode when API key is not available

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Railway**: Set `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Render**: Set `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Usage

1. Upload a clear image of a leg showing potential varicose veins
2. Click "Start Analysis" to begin AI analysis
3. Review the probability assessment and stage classification
4. Read the medical reasoning provided by the AI

## Varicose Vein Stages

- **Stage 1**: Spider veins (thin, web-like veins)
- **Stage 2**: Reticular veins (1-3mm, blue/green)
- **Stage 3**: Varicose veins (‚â•3mm, bulging, rope-like)
- **Stage 4**: Skin changes (pigmentation, eczema)
- **Stage 5**: Ulcers (open, non-healing wounds)

## Demo Mode

When no API key is configured, the app runs in demo mode with simulated analysis results. This allows you to test the interface and functionality without requiring an API key.
